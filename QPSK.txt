Very similar to PSK. Just a small change in the chunks to bits block. QPSK is more susceptible to noise than binary PSK but we can achieve higher data rates.
However one major issue we notice is that the energy is distributed into unwanted side lobes because of the quick transitions. We need to fix this using pulse shaping.
